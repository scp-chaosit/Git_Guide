# Git Commands Guide

## What is Git?
git is a tool (a command-line tool) that helps you working with code repositories and add them to online services (like GitHub, GitLab, etc)
git also helps you to track all your project versions and work with other developers without needs to rewrite all the code at slight changes of your colleagues

## Who is this guide for?
this guide will help you learn how to use git in your projects

## Structure
this file (README.md) is a file where I'd described everything to help you navigate in project

commands.md - a file with git commands to use 
pay attention that you NEED to use git in command line, so you better use GNU/Linux or macOS for git usage;
of course you can use git on Windows as well, but you need to download "git bash" console

screenshots - a directory (a directory word is similiar to a folder in Windows) with some screenshots about git working
usualy I move there some things that are long enough to write, so it is simplier just to make a screenshot

terms\_explanation.md - a file with explanation of some terms

## Be aware
this project (well, just a test one) is still in developement
so, there will be a lot of changes

## Where did information came from?
I took the information and screenshots from w3schools.com webschool
I'm suggesting you check this website, it is the best place to learn programming for free!
